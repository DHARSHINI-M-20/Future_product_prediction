With vanity sizing these days, every brand seems to be different. I typically wear an XL in most brands (6'0"" tall and 215 lbs - 44R suit size). I usually get XL to compensate for my beer belly, but these were quit large and baggy for me personally with my dimensions. I then ordered size Large because they were such a great price and find that they fit much better. Still roomy enough not to grip my belly too much and fit my frame much better. The V-Neck helps draw attention away from that awful looking beer gut. Further, the length is great as I am fairly tall in the torso and have a problem with most brands because they are not long enough. They did not shrink on the initial two washes/dries, but in my past experience with CK t-shirts, after repeated washing/drying they do tend to shrink a bit and lose their softness (around 1 year of use) - which is probably typical of most all brands and the repeated abuse of machine washing and high heat drying.",Great Shirts,1407456000,X-Large,Black,,,,,,

The foot is made out tights-like material and slips on easily. The ruffle is pretty, but oddly doesn't actually make a full circle- it just kind of overlaps at a random point and the ends aren't even finished, so it's a little bit scraggly. I guess that the nylon-style foot led to some sweating, because the bottoms made the dye from the inside of my shoes absorb into the sock- I washed them, but now the bottoms are blue. The shoes were cheap costume shoes, so I can't really blame that on the sock, but if you want the bottoms to stay white, beware colorful shoes. I thought I might wear them with ankle boots in a non-costume outfit, but they kept sort of slinking into my boot and with the scraggly edges, I wasn't crazy about looking like my feet were unraveling all day. I give them three stars, but I would just buy them if you have a one-night costume need and then toss them.","Good For Costumes, Not So Much For Everyday Wear",1407542400,One Size,White,5,,,,,

Additionally, I have long hair which can sometimes be problematic when wearing chains.  My hair can get caught in a clump near the clasp or I can inadvertantly break the chain when brushing my hair.  I chose the ""box"" type chain and this type of clasp for these reasons as it's the strongest chain available while still looking dainty.  I'm very pleased with both the quality and the price.  I tried to get the same kind of chain at our local department store and it was twice as much.  You won't be disappointed!",Very Pleased!!!,1234137600,,,,,,,,

I could not find the chain I was looking for.  Finally, I decided to look on Amazon and at first didn't see anything I was interested in.  I went back and looked on Amazon again the next day and saw a thin box chain, but I didn't know what a box chain looked like and the pictures only showed but so much.  So, I decided to wait.  The next day, I went to work and one of my co-workers was wearing an ""O"" pendant on a thin box chain like the one I saw online.  So, I ran home during lunch that day and went on Amazon to buy the chain.  I was so worried I wasn't going to find a chain that could be delivered to my house by Christmas.  Finally, when I almost gave up, out of all the box chains and sellers on Amazon, there was only one seller, Gemavenue, who's last acceptable order date for the holidays was still within the time limits.  So, I bought their box chain and it was perfect because I was able to choose the length I needed and it was thin but sturdy, like I had been looking for.  I asked for express shipping and ordered it on a Thursday and Christmas was on Tuesday.  The chain arrived that Saturday.  I was so thrilled when it arrived.

It looks like a fedora, not a sun hat.  And as to doing its job of sun protection, it is very good.  The brim keeps sun off of my face and neck, areas where I have had to have squamous cells removed. My body temperature is cooler with the hat on than off. The open mesh allows heat to escape and for any breeze to cool my head.
My only possible caveat: the mesh is a fairly open weave. If one is bald and must keep sun from the crown of the head, then it could be a problem.

Baseball hats work, but they only keep the sun off of whatever direction the bill is facing and being a solid lid, they make my head even sweatier than it would be normally.

I started looking around for a hat that would address all those shortcomings and everywhere I looked, I kept seeing ""Henschel Breezer"".  So, more digging led me to Amazon and all the reviews of said hat.  The reviews were good, the price was right and the best part is, made in America.

Ordered it and as with all things Amazon, it arrived on time and packaged perfectly to protect it.  I've used it every weekend and numerous other times in the aforementioned heinous heat and humidity and it has performed flawlessly.

I am fair skinned and wanted a wide-brimmed hat to protect my face, neck, and ears from the sun. The sizing is pretty much spot on (measure your head accurately before ordering) and the hat was very comfortable for an entire day's wear. We spent a lot of time in San Jose and Santa Cruz where the temps were in the 80s and a lot of sun. The hat kept my head cool, wicked the sweat, and I didn't get burned. I did use sun block, but worried less about re-application every 80 minutes on my face, ears and neck than I did for my arms and legs.

I haven't needed to wash the hat yet, but will take the necessary precautions to try and quickly dry the brim due to it having a wire inside. I hope to use this hat for several summers.","Great, stylish sun hat",1371772800,,,,,,,,

Buxton owns the rights to the Dopp name and produces these ""official Dopp"" kits. The leather is good, feels solid and well stitched, but you can also get them in a slightly less expensive PVC leatherette version. You can also find these in some stores although the ones I found were double in price. Sometimes the bottoms are leather and sometimes the bottoms were a beaded plastic. Frankly I made sure to get the beaded plastic as it will last longer than a leather bottom. The key features if this Dopp kit are: 1) Construction feels solid. (Although the tag says made in China...you would feel better if it had a proud to be made in the USA tag...however, I don't think this is an issue here.) The leather and stitching feels strong. The zipper is a hefty enough piece of metal that will last. The leather handle is small enough that it fits under the fold of the kit's side if you do not want to use it. The inside is a traditional liner with a single razor pouch, however, the liner and pouch feel like they are made of a newer composite plastic material than the older plastic liners these type of kits used to have. The liner feels stronger and I doubt it will rip, which often happened with travel kits. 2) It has Dopp stamped on it, on two flaps/tabs. The tabs are aesthetic choices but look good and remind you that you have a ""real"" Dopp and not some random ""Men's Toiletry Bag.""  There are newer types of ""Dopp"" kit's out there made out of nylon mesh. If you like that I would recommend something by L.L. Bean or Swiss Army.

4,TRUE,"07 25, 2015",A2ESGTC8OVQCCA,B00080L00Q,Yudhi Wiyono,"Purchased this on January 2015, and i gotta say this worth every penny i spent. I was looking for a simple, understated travel kit with no extra compartments or embossed logo on the exterior, and this is exactly what i want.

Pros:
- Feels and smells like genuine leather, smooth leather. (It's better to use leather care lotion once in a while as mine has started to show some creases, probably due to hot weather)
- Neat and strong stitching along the bottom, the opening, and the inner artificial fabric (see photos)
- Bottom material is made of waterproof artificial fabric, wide and hard
Cons:
- I wish the inside pouch were slightly bigger, with a zipper so stuff won't fall off, and can store more stuff
- Holds less and more expensive than my Nautica travel kit (see photos)

Overall, it's a great product, and with little ocassional care i'm sure this will lasts for years.",Classic sophisticated dopp kit,1437782400,One Size,Brown,30,"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Uxsts-+LL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61SHfn2a6uL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/619FYS4UinL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71bcc-wnxcL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71LoZY6mfcL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Q47CfIlSL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71lBuvQrOQL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-L7TNyiVL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/712zkeoY-zL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71dCdbQiY1L._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71r6DhRQalL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81nCs1r2RKL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61QxDUnF1VL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/711hwKtJPAL._SY88.jpg']",,,,

After wearing out the plastic travel bag I've had since then, I wanted to go back to the classic Dopp.  The Admiral did not disappoint - it's a great travel companion!  The sides are a nice, soft leather, the bottom a vinyl which is appropriate, given that the bag will be placed on wet countertops.  The stand-up top stays open for easy retrieval of essentials then securely snaps shut; the bag is closed by a heavy-duty zipper.  Inside the bag is a water-resistant liner with one side pocket for small items. The Admiral Dopp is really lightweight but very well made and stows nicely in an overnight bag - a handsome, high-quality, timeless design.
